# React Lesson 10 — Responding to Events (Vite + React 19)

A small, ready-to-run app that demonstrates:
- `useState` for interactivity
- Event handlers (`onClick`, `onSubmit`)
- Passing handler props from parent to child
- Event bubbling and `stopPropagation`
- `preventDefault` with form submission
- Side effects within event handlers

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Explore

- Edit `src/App.jsx` to play with handlers and state.
- Replace the image URLs in `images` for your own gallery.
